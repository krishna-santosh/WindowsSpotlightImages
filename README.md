A better version of this application is available at [krishna-santosh/Windows_Spotlight](https://github.com/krishna-santosh/Windows_Spotlight) üå±

- No external dependencies required (like Python)
- Lightweight and efficient
- Improved performance
- Easy Installation

I highly recommend using the new version for a better experience.
